# Facial-Recognition-With-Raspberry-Pi

<b>Project Description</b>

For our project, we used a Raspberry Pi machine and a webcam to perform real-time image processing, in order to recognize and classify faces from both still images and actual people placed in front of the camera. In order for this classification to occur, we trained an OpenCV Facial Recognizer model using images captured by the webcam, as well as still life images gathered from the internet.
