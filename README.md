# Facial-Recognition-With-Raspberry-Pi
Motivation
We set out to create an application which could use the Raspberry Piâ€™s webcam to detect and recognize faces in real time. With the growing use of facial recognition in everyday laptops and smartphones, this seemed like it would be an exciting and intriguing way to explore computer vision.

Project Description
For our project, we used a Raspberry Pi machine and a webcam to perform real-time image processing, in order to recognize and classify faces from both still images and actual people placed in front of the camera. In order for this classification to occur, we trained an OpenCV Facial Recognizer model using images captured by the webcam, as well as still life images gathered from the internet.
